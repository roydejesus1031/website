# Welcome
I am a DevOps Engineer at Coconut Software specializing in Automation, Build & Release Engineering, and DevOps practices. I am also an AWS Certified Associate Solutions Architect.

My experience and technologies used include: Python, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI/CD, Amazon Web Services(AWS), Google Cloud Platform(GCP), Docker, Git, Linux(Ubuntu), Prometheus, and Grafana.

This website is both my personal site and a "project" to learn some new things. Nearly everything for this website, from the cloud infrastructure on GCP to the static files, exists as code in [this repo](https://github.com/roydejesus1031/website) and is automatically updated as the repository changes. It uses Terraform, Github Actions, and GCP services like Workload Identities for this. The process is explained in more depth in the [site creation post]({{< ref "/post/creation" >}} "How this site is built and deployed").
