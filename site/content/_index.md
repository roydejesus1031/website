# Welcome
I am an Infrastructure Engineer specializing in fields such as DevOps, Automation, and Build & Release Engineering.

My experience and technologies used includes: Python, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI/CD, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Git, Linux(Ubuntu), Prometheus, and Grafana.

This website is both my personal site and a "project" to learn some new things. Nearly everything for this website, from the cloud infrastructure on GCP to the actual static files, exists as code in [this repo](https://github.com/roydejesus1031/website) and is automatically updated as the repository is updated. It uses Terraform, Github Actions, and some GCP services like Workload Identities for this.
